# ===================================================================
# CONFIGURATION NOTES:
# ===================================================================
# 
# 1. REPLACE 'your_validator_hotkey_ss58_here' with your actual validator hotkey
# 
# 2. STRATEGY OVERVIEW:
#    - DCA 0.05 TAO every 12 hours into SN73 alpha
#    - Each DCA creates a sell order at +15% profit
#    - Stop DCA when total investment reaches 5.0 TAO
#    - Continue managing sell orders until positions close
# 
# 3. TIMELINE: ~50 days to reach 5 TAO cap (100 DCA purchases)
# 
# 4. POSITION MANAGEMENT:
#    - Each 0.05 TAO DCA becomes a tracked position
#    - Sell when SN73 alpha price reaches 15% above buy price
#    - Use profits to potentially restart DCA if under cap
# 
# 5. EARLY ADOPTER THESIS:
#    - SN73 (MetaHash) launched April 2025 - very new subnet
#    - OTC marketplace infrastructure play
#    - Potential for significant appreciation as subnet matures
# 
# ===================================================================
# RISK WARNINGS:
# ===================================================================
# 
# - SN73 is experimental and very new (4 months old)
# - Limited liquidity and price history
# - High-risk, high-reward early adopter strategy
# - Only invest what you can afford to lose
# - Monitor closely during first few weeks
